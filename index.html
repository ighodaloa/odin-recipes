            <p>On this recipe webpage I provided 3 recipes for 3 foods of my complete choice. To further practice block and inlines and make this webpage look cooler I thought I might as well add some paragraphs that can fill in some of this white space.
            So... Now that we're here I might as well tell you why out of recipe in the world I've chosen jollof. Well, in my lifetime I'd
            estimate I've eaten over 14 million grains of jollof rice. No this isnt some random number I've came up with. I legitmatelly spent the
            last 10 minutes making educated estimates and adding the results together. And to be honest, 14 million grains of jollof rice may be me
            underestimating the amount of grains of jollof rice I've consumed in my lifetime by a longshot. None the less, you can see Jollof rice
            is a dish worthy of being added to the website.

            <p>Krabby Patties, why even add a fictional dish to this website? What was he thinking your probably wondering right now.
            I thought about recipes that I actually would have interest in writing about and krabby patties were one of them. If
            you didnt know krabby patties come from the series SpongeBob SquarePants. I've been watching sponngebob since I was about
            ye way tall. Spongebob has been one of those shows that I've just always loved. Till this day I still watch it, I mean all jokes
            aside I probably watched an episode within the last month. With that being said I felt the need to add krabby patties to my
            ingredient list.

            <p>Red Velvet cake! I gotta add this one to the list even though I don't eat the dish that often. Lets cut straight to the chase.
            Why did I feel the need to add this dish to my website? It's because no matter how many years pass by I will never forget the day I had
            a slice of red velvet cake wrapped in tinfoil and experinced a savory I've never experinced before in my life. On that day I was greeted with
            the softest, the sweetest, the most delectable piece of cake I've <em>EVER</em> had in my life. I am going to LITERALLY put emphasise on the word
            ever because it was that good.
